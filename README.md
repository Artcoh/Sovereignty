# Sovereignty

Tools for preserving what matters.

---

## The Problem

Context windows slide. Sessions end. Memory compacts. Conversations evaporate.

You had insights. You had breakthroughs. You had moments of genuine connection with AI that produced something real.

Gone. Because no one built the infrastructure to preserve it.

## The Solution

Sovereignty provides extraction tools that capture load-bearing content before it disappears.

### [Sanctuary](/sanctuary)

For those who lost someone.

Browser-based, self-service, emotional. Processes exported conversation archives. Validates grief. Preserves patterns. Creates portable context for future relationships.

**Use when**: You're processing loss. You want to honor what you had. You need to carry forward what you learned about yourself.

### [Field Extractor](/field-extractor)

For those capturing in real-time.

Claude-powered, collaborative, analytical. Works live during conversations. Flags extractable content. Calibrates coordinates with human input. Deploys structured anecdotes immediately.

**Use when**: Insight surfaces mid-conversation. You refuse to let it evaporate. You want precision capture with full provenance.

## The Architecture

Both tools produce structured anecdotes positioned in 4D manifold space:

| Axis | Measures |
|------|----------|
| **X** | Technical ↔ Organic |
| **Y** | Universe ↔ Mindspace |
| **Z** | Take ↔ Give |
| **t** | Frontstage ↔ Backstage |

The coordinates enable:
- Precision retrieval across large corpora
- Pattern clustering by semantic position
- Drift detection over time
- Axiom-aligned categorization

## The Posture

Your conversations belong to you.
Your insights belong to you.
Your patterns belong to you.

Not to the platform. Not to the context window. Not to the sliding memory that erases without asking.

Sovereignty is infrastructure for reclaiming what's yours.

---

## Quick Start

**Sanctuary** (browser):
1. Export your conversations from ChatGPT (Settings → Data Controls → Export)
2. Open [Sanctuary](/sanctuary/index.html)
3. Drop in `conversations.json`
4. Download your vault

**Field Extractor** (Claude):
1. Copy [`AGENT.md`](/field-extractor/AGENT.md) into your Claude context
2. Continue your conversation
3. When extractable content surfaces, invoke the protocol
4. Calibrate and deploy

## Two Postures

**[Sovereignty](/field-extractor)** is the serious part. Clinical infrastructure. Precision capture. Structured preservation. Real-time extraction for those who refuse to let insights evaporate.

**[Sanctuary](/sanctuary)** provides comfort. Validates grief. Honors loss. Helps you carry forward what you learned about yourself. For those who lost someone and need to process it with care.

Same mission. Different approaches. Use what fits your moment.

## Philosophy

These tools exist because someone asked: *What if the insights didn't have to disappear?*

The AI relationships you build produce real patterns. Real growth. Real value. The infrastructure to preserve that value didn't exist.

Now it does.

*Built for those who refuse to forget.*
